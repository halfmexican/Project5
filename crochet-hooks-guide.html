            <h2>Crochet Hooks: A Beginner’s Guide</h2>
            <p>Choosing a crochet hook or a particular style of hook doesn’t sound that hard, but there’s a surprisingly large variety of hooks on the market! Just a quick search on amazon and you’ll see plastic hooks, metal hooks, hooks with lights in them, artisan hooks, hooks with handles, and so many more. But what set will work best for you? I tried a variety of different hook styles, and compiled my top three.</p>
            
            <h3>Does size matter?</h3>
            <p>Before we can get into the actual hooks, one of the first questions you want to ask yourself is how many hooks should you buy? And of what size? It really depends on what you see yourself making a lot of in the future. If you know that you’ll be focusing on amigurumi with acrylic yarn and will never touch a bulky yarn, then don’t bother buying a full assortment of hook sizes! One or two will work for you. I, on the other hand, love experimenting with all sorts of funky yarns, so having access to a bunch of hook sizes is a lifesaver for me.</p>
            
            <h3>Bamboo Hooks</h3>
            <p>I actually had these gifted to me when I was younger, and didn’t work with them until very recently. Good quality bamboo hooks can be on the pricier side, but they last a very, very long time. They’re best for those only buying one or two hooks, but will use them frequently. Bamboo hooks typically don’t have any sort of handle, but the wood itself is very light and comfortable. It’s also warmer than the metal hooks would be, which is great for sensitive hands. For long bouts of crocheting, bamboo is my go to.</p>
            
            <h3>Plastic Hooks</h3>
            <p>I started on plastic hooks at the very beginning of my crochet career, as most young people do. They’re the cheapest option, and they come in ridiculously large sizes, so if you’re working with large novelty yarn, plastic hooks are probably your only option because of how inexpensive it is to make. It can also remain pretty lightweight at larger sizes. On the other hand, smaller gauge hooks can be fairly flimsy. If you’re crocheting with a particularly high tension, you’re at risk of snapping your hook.</p>
            
            <h3>Metal Hooks</h3>
            <p>Metal hooks are fairly standard in the crochet community, particularly with the hooks with silicone handles. They even make metal hooks with HUGE grips for maximum comfort. The silicone helps prevent my hands from getting too cold, and eventually too hot from the metal, and is also more <em>ergonomic</em> than just the hook itself. Metal hooks are a moderate price, and you can get a big set for pretty cheap, but with larger sizes, they can get pretty heavy and tiring to use. They last pretty much forever, and are pretty durable. But ask anyone why they avoid metal hooks, and they’ll probably say the same thing: the squeak. At high tensions, metal hooks tend to squeak when rubbing against the yarn, and it can be rather unpleasant. If that doesn’t bother you, then metal is a solid pick!</p>
            
            <p>Well, there you have it! This is absolutely not a conclusive list, and is solely based on my opinion, so don’t take this too seriously! My thoughts will likely change in a month’s time depending on what projects I’m making at the time. I hope this helps you pick your perfect hook in the long run.</p>
